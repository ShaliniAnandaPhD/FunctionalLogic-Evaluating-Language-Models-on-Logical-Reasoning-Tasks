FunctionalLogic: Evaluating Language Models on Logical Reasoning Task


1. Syllogistic Reasoning: Given a set of syllogistic premises, determine the valid conclusion(s) that follow from the premises.

2. Propositional Logic: Evaluate the truth value of a complex propositional logic statement based on the truth values of its constituent propositions.

3. First-Order Logic: Given a set of first-order logic sentences and a query, determine whether the query can be inferred from the sentences using first-order logic inference rules.

4. Logical Entailment: Determine whether a given statement logically entails another statement using natural language inference techniques.

5. Logical Consistency: Check whether a set of statements is logically consistent, i.e., whether they can all be true simultaneously without leading to a contradiction.

6. Logical Equivalence: Determine whether two logical statements are logically equivalent, i.e., whether they have the same truth value under all possible interpretations.

7. Logical Fallacy Detection: Identify and classify logical fallacies present in a given argument or piece of text.

8. Logical Analogy: Complete a logical analogy by identifying the relationship between given pairs and selecting the most appropriate option to complete the analogy.

9. Logical Reasoning in Context: Given a passage containing logical statements and a question, determine the answer to the question based on the information provided in the passage.

10. Logical Puzzle Solving: Solve a logical puzzle by using given clues and constraints to deduce the correct solution.

11. Logical Inference Chain: Generate a valid logical inference chain that leads from a set of premises to a given conclusion.

12. Logical Contradiction Detection: Identify contradictions within a set of statements and pinpoint the specific statements causing the contradiction.

13. Logical Reasoning with Quantifiers: Evaluate the truth value of statements involving logical quantifiers (e.g., "for all," "there exists") and determine the validity of arguments involving quantified statements.

14. Logical Reasoning with Modal Logic: Assess the validity of arguments involving modal logic operators (e.g., "necessarily," "possibly") and determine the truth values of modal statements.

15. Counterfactual Reasoning: Given a set of statements describing a scenario and a counterfactual statement, determine the implications and consequences of the counterfactual statement within the given context.

These tasks cover a range of logical reasoning skills and can be used to evaluate the performance of language models in terms of their ability to understand and manipulate logical statements, draw valid inferences, detect inconsistencies, and reason about complex logical relationships.

Each task can be formulated as a specific problem with input statements, desired outputs, and evaluation criteria, similar to the example provided in the previous response. The language model's performance on these tasks can be assessed based on the correctness of its responses, adherence to logical principles, and the quality of its explanations and reasoning.

Tests on different language models, specific tasks and results coming up!
